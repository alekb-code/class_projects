## Honors Engineering Analysis I (Gen_Eng 206-1)
To supplement our learning of lienar algebra, we wrote some scripts in MATLAB to solve different problems/tasks. Code files can be found [here](Honors%20Engineering%20Analysis%20I%20%28Gen_Eng%20206-1%29).


## Honors Calculus for Engineers I (Es_Appm 252-1)
While learning Multivariable Differential Calculus, we used python to solve computational problem related to the topics we were learning. Code files can be found [here](Honors%20Calculus%20for%20Engineers%20I%20%28ES_APPM%20252-1%29).
