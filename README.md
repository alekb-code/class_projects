## Intro to Electrical Engineering (Elec_Eng 202)
Shout out to my lab partners AJ Klein and Max Maiers.

### Useless Box
We built a useless box, which turns itself off when its turned on. We then reconstructed this box to operate with an ESP32 microcontroller along with code to operate it. Finally, we edited the code to give the box some "personality." Images of the circuit as well as the .ino code files can be found [here](Intro%20to%20Electrical%20Engineering%20(Elec_Eng%20202)/UselessBox).

### LED Matrix
We first built a simple 3x3 LED matrix that could be controlled by shift registers. After that, we learned about filtering and built our own filter circuit with four bands. We then combined this filter circuit with a PCB we soldered (PCB design credit to Prof. Ilya Mickelson) to make an audio spectrum vizualizer. Finally, used a larger prebuilt LED matrix and microphone to apply these topics on a larger scale. Images and code of the project throughout each step can be found [here](Intro%20to%20Electrical%20Engineering%20(Elec_Eng%20202)/LEDMatrix).

## Honors Engineering Analysis I (Gen_Eng 206-1)
To supplement our learning of lienar algebra, we wrote some scripts in MATLAB to solve different problems/tasks. Code files can be found [here](Honors%20Engineering%20Analysis%20I%20%28Gen_Eng%20206-1%29).

## Honors Calculus for Engineers I (Es_Appm 252-1)
While learning Multivariable Differential Calculus, we used python to solve computational problem related to the topics we were learning. Code files can be found [here](Honors%20Calculus%20for%20Engineers%20I%20%28ES_APPM%20252-1%29).
